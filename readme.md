# Task Description

Using only the standard library, create a Go HTTP server that on each request responds with a counter of the total number of requests that it has received during the previous 60 seconds (moving window). The server should continue to the return the correct numbers after restarting it, by persisting data to a file.

## Refinement of requirements

[X] The server must be race-condition free and able to handle multiple requests.

[X] The server should be efficient when interacting with the filesystem.

[ ] Precision should not be compromised.

[ ] There should be proper tests in place to make sure that these conditions hold.

## Architecture

The pipeline of data looks like this:
```
......... f    ..........   g   ........  h  .........
Server --writes to---> datastructure -writes to-> file
       \_concurrent_/
```
Constraints:

- f:  can only append to queue
- g:  is an endomorphism that keeps old data outside
- h1: has read only access to queue
- h2: writes efficiently to file

h = h2 . h1

Procrastinating a little bit, made a better picture :)
```

## Philosophy

I decided to use a FIFO queue instead of PriorityQueue because it's easier and faster but there is the possibility of there being some jitter (where timestamps that are very close to each other get swapped, i.e. put in inverse order).

This means that I prioritized throughput over precision.

However I can only use the standard library and they don't offer a good queue so the throughput is somewhat dampened by that.

The user is asking at the granularity of second so the answer is approximately correct for this granularity.

## Implementation

The actual implementation writes to two files and clears one of them every half minute, this is to avoid blocking, but since the write channel is buffered it's not really a problem if the writer blocks..

Another quirk of the implementation is that the datastructure clears out old timestamps twice a second. There's a number of problems with this approach.

The worst hack is making the queue variable global, I wanted to have direct read access from the handler threads but probably a better solution is just to use a buffered channel again and have the queue be owned by the funnel.

Overall I think the solution is quite good though, if it just had tests and if I refactored it to take advantage of some of the lessons learned along the way, then I'd be pretty happy. However, refining this thing any further is not really a good use of my time at this moment. Maybe I'll come back to it in a few days.

I didn't look further into the timestamp layout, I'm sure that could be improved as well.
